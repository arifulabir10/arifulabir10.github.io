        <h3> Home town</h3>
        <p> My hometown is Bhramnbaria,Chittagong. But I permanently live in Khilkhet,Dhaka.</p>
        <h3>Academic History</h3>
    <p>I completed my SSC and HSC from Milestone School and Milestone College. 
        Both of these institutions are the same but the name is different because of school level and college level. 
        I completed my SSC in 2016 and HSC in 2018. I got GPA:5.00 in SSC and GPA:4.33 in HSC.</P>

    <h3>Why I Chose CSE?</h3>
    <p>First of all, CSE was not in my list. I wanted to become a doctor. My first choice was to become a doctor. 
        I tried my luck there but the luck was not on my side. 
        Then I tried my luck for Dental College, again I failed. I didn't had any interest in Dhaka University. 
        Because of family pressure I had to sit for the admission test.
        The most interesting thing in my life took place there.I went to Dhaka University on the exam day without any preparation. 
        I saw the Dhaka University Campus for the first time in my life and I fall in love because of the beauty of the campus 
        and I wanted to be a part of this University but it was too late. Then I heard that there is a subject called "CSE". 
        I asked to my friends,"What is this CSE". Believe me or not, I had no clue what this thing was. 
        Then I started collecting informations  about CSE. Then me and my friend Shimanto decided to 
        explore few private universities inside Dhaka for CSE. Then we went to Daffodil University in Ashulia. The campus was mind
        blowing beautiful but it was too far away from my home. 
        That's why we deleted this one from our list. Then we went to AIUB. It is a good quality university but too much expensive for me. 
        My another friend Mushfiq is in AIUB now(2nd trimester). While talking to him I heard about a university called "UIU".
        Then me and Shimanto decided to try our luck for the last time. We chose CSE for the admission test and fortunately passed 
        the test. After that I buried all my dreams inside my chest and started for a new destination through CSE.
        That's how CSE came in my life.
