        <h3> Home town</h3>
        <p> My hometown is Bhramnbaria,Chittagong. But we permanently live in Khilkhet,Dhaka.</p>
        <h3>Academic History</h3>
    <p>I completed my SSC and HSC from Milestone School and Milestone College. 
        Both of these institutions are the same but the name is different because of school level and college level. 
        I completed my SSC in 2016 and HSC in 2018. I got GPA:5.00 in SSC and GPA:4.33 in HSC.</P>
    <h3>Why I Chose CSE?</h3>
    <p>First of all, CSE was not in my list. I wanted to become a doctor. My first choice was to become a doctor. 
        I tried my luck there but the luck was not on my side. 
        Then I tried my luck for Dental Medical, again I failed. I didn't had interest in Dhaka University. Because of family pressure I had to sit for the admission test there.
        The most interesting thing in my life took place there.I went to Dhaka University on the exam day without any preparation. I saw the Dhaka University Campus for the first time in my life and I fell in love because of the beauty of the campus itself and I wanted to be a part of this University but it was too late.
